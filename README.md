## Project thoughts

Very fun project that I enjoyed working on a lot. I happened to be watching the first episode of pokemon for the first time in awhile when I opened the email to read the details of this project which made me laugh. I could have used local storage to remember the past searches through refreshes but I wanted to keep it simple and use redux as much as possible to show that. Thanks again for the opportunity!
